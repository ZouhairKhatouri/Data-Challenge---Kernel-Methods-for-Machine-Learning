# Data-Challenge---Kernel-Methods-for-Machine-Learning

## Abstract:

The goal of this Data Challenge was to classify some images using Kernel methods. As the raw images arenâ€™t humanly recognizable, I extracted three local features from these images to use them as an input to my model. After implementing and testing many classifications methods, I finally chose to retain a one-versus-all SVC using an RBF kernel as a model.

## How to use the code:

Launch the script start.py using:

*python start.py*

## Other tested tracks:

A folder containing classes implementing other classification algorithms that are used is the main script.
